This is work in progress. Eventually it will become the cli tools for running
client-side tests with Buster.JS in multiple browsers through buster-server.

Getting started
---------------
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd node_modules/glob
make
cd ../../
./run-tests
node test/integration/reporter-test.js
